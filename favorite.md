# Bryan's Favorite Text Editor

### Nano

Nano wound up being my favorite editor because I found it to be the easiest to use.

Vim was difficult to get the hang of, and I found it somewhat cumbersome to jump between the insertion and command modes.

Emacs seemed to be a bit more powerful than Nano, and it was the only editor that I was able to apply italics to text in order to perfectly
match the "unix_philosophy.pdf". I think that if I get the hang of the shortcuts with Emacs, it might be a better choice than Nano.

Once I got used to the idea of the buffer in Emacs, that made more sense. However, the ease of use with Nano was hard to resist.
Files were automatically saved as I worked on them, and as a beginner, it's nice to have commands listed at the bottom of the editor.

I think in the future, I'll try to dive deeper with Emacs, unless I just need to type out a quick text file, in which case Nano worked well for me.
